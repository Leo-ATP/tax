# Tax note: HDHP, HSA, FSA, etc.

The yearly open enrollment has started. In this article I will explain
the basic concepts and common concerns, and hope this helps you to make
the right decision.

### HDHP

High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP) is a health insurance just like any
other but with high deductible.

To qualify for HDHP, it must meet the minumum deductible and maximum
out of packet requirements. For 2018, the dollar amounts are listed below:

| Year | Minimum deductible (single) | Minimum deductible (family)	| Maximum out-of-pocket (single) | Maximum out-of-pocket (family) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | $1,350 | $2,700 | $6,650 | $13,300 |

[hdhp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-deductible_health_plan).

With _high_ deductible, you pay _low_ premium. This is ideal for those
who do not expect to have major medical expenses. If you do, you pay up
to your out of pocket maximum, and insurance will pay the rest without
upper bound. This is what the insurance should be: you pay what you can
afford, and insurance pays what you cannot.

HDHP has another advantage, Health Savings Account, or HSA. However
before we can talk about HSA, I have to explain what FICA tax is.

### FICA

The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax, also called payroll or
employment tax, is a tax imposed to fund Social Security and Medicare. The
employee and employer each pays 50%. The employee's portion is reported
in W-2 Box 4 (social security tax) and Box 6 (medicare tax). Click
[w2](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf) to see the boxes. The
employee's portion of social security tax is 6.2% up to $128,800 (2018)
and medicare tax is 1.45% without limit plus additional medicare tax on
Form 8959.

The self employed person pays 100% of the FICA tax in the form of self
employment tax with a deduction of 7.65% on the base amount. The F1
students in CPT are exempt from the tax, but usually smaller companies
with little experience hiring foreign workers collect FICA tax they
should not.

[fica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Insurance_Contributions_Act_tax).

### HSA

If you participate HDHP, you can have Health Savings Account, or HSA,
which is an investment account for medical purposes with the tax
advantages:

- Contribution is tax deductible up to a limit
- Gain from investment is tax free

Contribution come from:

- Payroll deduction
- Personal contribution

Both are income tax deductible. Payroll deduction is also free rom paying
FICA taxes while personal contribution is not.

IRS puts limit on how much you can contribute, for 2018 the dollar
amounts are:

| Year | Contribution Limit (Single) | Contribution Limit (Family) | Catch-Up Contribution (55 or older) (Single and Family) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2018 | $3,450 | $6,900 | $1,000 |

[hsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account).

Then what happened to Health FSA? we will talk next section.

### FSA (Health)

The Health Flexible Spending Account, or Health FSA, is the pretaxed
account to pay for health care expenses. _If you have HDHP and HSA_, you
are eligible to _Limited Purpose_ FSA, which can be used to for _dental_
and _vision_ expenses only, not _medical_ expenses.

Traditionally, it has a use or lose policy, but a recent development
allows up to $500 carryover to next year. You should contribute to
health care FSA when you maxed out the HSA (if you has HDHP and qualify
for HSA), and the maximum contribution should be the projected expenses
less existing balance in FSA plus $500 (or the plan limit if lower).

Example, if you have $200 existing balance, and you projected expenses
are 600, you should contribute up to $600 - $200 + $500 = $900. Let us
verify it, with your $900 contribution and $200 existing balance, your
available balance is $1100. After deducting $600 expense, you year end
balance is $500 which can be carried over to next year.

The gory detail of the Health FSA carryover rules can be found by click
[carryover](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-13-71.pdf).

### FSA (Dependent)

For dependent care, you have a choice to use the pretaxed Dependent care
FSA, or claim the dependent care credit on Form 2441, or a combination of
both. What is the difference between the two and which one I should use?

* First of all, the rate is different. The dependent care
FSA saves taxes on your maximum tax rate (tax bracket) plus
FICA taxes, while tax credit saves income tax only at a rate
between 20% and 35% depending on income level as listed on [Form
2441](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2441.pdf). If you taxable income
is more than $43,000 and tax bracket is more than 20%, you should use
dependent FSA instead of tax credit.

* Secondly, the limit. You can put $5,000 _per household_ in dependent
care FSA regardless regardless how many children you have, while you
can claim up to $3,000 (for one child) or $6,000 (for two or more
children) less what you put in dependent care FSA. For example, if you
have one child, you can put $5,000 in dependent care FSA and claim 0
tax credit. If you have two or more children, you can still put $5,000
in dependent FSA and claim up to $1,000 tax credit if you do have more
than $6,000 qualified expenses.

* Thirdly, forfeit and adding back. If you set up dependent care FSA
but you do not have qualified expenses, the money will be forfeited
but you do not pay tax on the amount forfeited. If you use the money to
pay to qualified expenses, but you cannot claim the child (for example,
you ex claimed it), then the amount needs to add back and be taxed. With
out of pocket expenses, there is no forfei, and no adding back because
nothing was deducted in the first place. If you cannot claim the child,
you just cannot claim the credit.

Dependent FSA is reported on box 10 of
[w2](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw2.pdf). Unlike a health FSA,
a dependent care FSA can't have a carryover feature.

### HSA versus FSA (Health)

| \ | HSA | Health FSA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership | You | Employer |
| When to contribute | Set at open enrollment | Any time |
| Limit | 3450(Self) / 6900(Family) + 1000(Catchup) (2018) | 2650 per FSA (2018) |
| Fund availability | When contributed | First day |
| Investment | Yes | No |
| Carryover | Unlimited | Up to $500 |
| Tax documents needed | 1099-SA (distribution) and 5498-SA (contribution) or equivalent information | W-2 |

I hope the information is useful. The tax laws are complicated, I tried
to cover the most common cases, but I still find it hard to explain it
in simple terms. If you need further clarification, please ask.
