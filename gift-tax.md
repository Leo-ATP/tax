## Tax notes: gift tax basics

### When to file form 709?

If you are

- Resident _or_ 
- Nonresident giving U.S. property

who

- gives a gift of present interest more than annual exclusion $14,000 (2017) to _one_ person _or_  
- gives a gift of future interest of amount _or_ 
- makes elects to split gift with spouse (each has a annual exclusion amount)

Then you need file form 709, but filing gift return does not mean that you need pay gift tax.

### When to pay tax?

When accumulated amount (after annual exclusion) is more than life time exclusion $5,490,000 (2017), you pay gift tax at 40% (2017) gift tax, and additional generation skip tax (40% as well, 2017) if gift is for a generation skip person (grand children and below).

### How to report?

- Charitable gift is fully excluded but need to report
- Generation Skip gift needs separately reported becauase it is subject to additional GST tax.
- Gift for medical purpose paid directly to hospital and nursing home needs not report
- Gift for education paid directly to institution needs not report

P.S. _A "U.S. person"_ who received more than $100,000 from _a nonresident_ (your parent as an example) needs to file _Form 3520_.
The $100,000 limit is for the amount received by _one_ "U.S. person" from _one_ nonresident. However, if the givers are related,
then they should be regarded as one person per [Instructions for Form 3520](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i3520.pdf). Only the
spouse who exceeded the limit needs for file form 3520. When both spouses exceeded the limit, they file separate forms 3520
and "check the box if you are married and filing a joint 2017 income tax return, but you are filing separate Forms 3520" on the
form.
