## Tax notes: gift tax basics

### When to file form 709?

If you are

- Resident _or_ 
- Nonresident giving U.S. property

who

- gives a gift of present interest more than annual exclusion $14,000 (2017) to _one_ person _or_  
- gives a gift of future interest of amount _or_ 
- makes elects to split gift with spouse (each has a annual exclusion amount)

Then you need file form 709, but filing gift return does not mean that you need pay gift tax.

### When to pay tax?

When accumulated amount (after annual exclusion) is more than life time exclusion $5,490,000 (2017), you pay gift tax at 40% (2017) gift tax, and additional generation skip tax (40% as well, 2017) if gift is for a generation skip person (grand children and below).

### How to report?

- Charitable gift is fully excluded but need to report
- Generation Skip gift needs separately reported becauase it is subject to additional GST tax.
- Gift for medical purpose paid directly to hospital and nursing home needs not report
- Gift for education paid directly to institution needs not report

P.S. A "U.S. person" who has received more than $100,000 from a nonresident (your parent as an example) needs to file _Form 3520_.
