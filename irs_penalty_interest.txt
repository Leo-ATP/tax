Tax note: Penalty and interest

Besides taxes, IRS charge various penalties and interest.

First, IRS requires that the tax due on every quarter to be paid
on time, if not, there will be "estimated tax penalty" or Form 2210
penalty because the penalty is calculated on Form 2210. It is possible
that at the end of year, you will get a refund but still owe estimated
tax penalty because the obligation of a particular quarter was not met.
Although it is called "penalty", it is calculated based on interest.
The penalty enters in Form 1040 on page 2 line 79.

If you do not file and pay tax on time, there will be additional fail
to file penalty, fail to pay penalty, and additional interest until it
is paid.

The fail to file penalty is 5% per month or partial month up to 25%
of the tax owed [IRC Section 6651(a)(1)].

The fail to pay penalty is 0.5% per month or partial month up to 25%
of the tax owed [IRC Section 6651(a)(2)].

If you owe both fail to file penalty and fail to pay penalty, the fail
to file penalty is reduced by the amount of fail to pay penalty [IRC
Section 6651(c)(1)].

The interest is calculated based on the federal short term interest rate
[1] rounded to closet integer plus 3%, changed every quarter, accumulated
daily. As the calculation involves the "advanced" math, Rev. Proc. 95-17
provided the "Factor Tables" to calculated the interest for the quarter
for different interest rate, number of days of the quarter the
was due, and whether the year is leap year or not [2].

Let me use an example to demonstrate how these amounts are
calculated. Suppose you did not file nor pay 2014 tax due on 2015-04-15,
and you owe $10,000 in tax.

The fail to file penalty is 5% per month or per partial month up to 5
month (the maximum penalty will not exceed 25%) reduced by fail to pay
penalty 0.5% per month or per partial month for the period. Therefore
we have:

Fail to file penalty = $10,000 * 5% * 5 - $10,000 * 0.5% * 5 = $2,250

The fail to pay penalty is 0.5% per month or per partial month for 31
full or partial months (From 2015-04-15 to 2017-10-26):

Fail to pay penalty = $10,000 * 0.5% * 31 = $1,550

The interest was 3% for first 351 days (from 2015-04-15 to 2016-03-31),
and 4% for the rest of 574 days (from 2016-04-01 to 2017-10-26),
accumulated daily, the total interest is:

Interest = $12,250 * [ (1 + 3%/365)^351 * (1 + 3%/366)^574 -1 ] =
$1,174.79

Please note the base amount is the tax owed plus the fail to file
penaty [IRM 20.2.5.3(2)], and 2016 is a leap year.

If we use the IRS table method to calculate interest quarter by quarter,
the result is $1,175.72. The difference due to rounding is less than
a dollar.
