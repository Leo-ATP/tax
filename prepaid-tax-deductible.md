## Prepay property tax for 2018 in 2017 deductible?

The most authorative document is the US code, so let us first look at the [26 U.S. Code ยง 164](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/164) which says:

>Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following taxes shall be allowed as a deduction for the taxable year within which paid or accrued:
>
* (1) State and local, and foreign, real property taxes. 
* (2) State and local personal property taxes.
* (3) State and local, and foreign, income, war profits, and excess profits taxes. 
* (4) The GST tax imposed on income distributions.

There is anything said about prepaid tax is deductible or not. So let us look at the court cases as documented in revenue rulings:

* [Revenue Ruling 71-190](http://www.legalbitstream.com/scripts/isyswebext.dll?op=get&uri=/isysquery/irl3310/4/doc) "A payment of estimated Kentucky State income tax as reported on a tentative calendar year return by a cash basis taxpayer is deductible in the year of payment".
* [Revenue Ruling 82-208](http://www.legalbitstream.com/scripts/isyswebext.dll?op=get&uri=/isysquery/irl3336/1/doc) which says "a taxpayer, pursuant to state law authorizing such payment, makes an estimated payment of state income taxes that is reasonably determined in good faith at the time of payment, such payments are deductible under section 164(a)(3) of the Code."

This means the prepaid _state income tax_ would be deductible except that the final version of the [tax cut and jobs act](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20171218/CRPT-115HRPT-466.pdf) add a specific provision preventing this:

>Thus, under the provision, an individual may not claim an itemized deduction in 2017 on a pre-payment of _income tax_ for a future taxable year in order to avoid the dollar limitation applicable for taxable years beginning after 2017.

Neither the US code nor the court cases address the _property tax_. By the similarity of the previous court cases, and none of the US code prohibiting this, it is a natural conclusion that prepaid property tax should be deductible in the year paid under the similar conditions that it is a payment, not a deposit, and that the payment was made in good faith that you actually owe the amount of tax. 

News reports and blogs on the net are not authorative documents, but it is interesting to see what people say on the topic.

[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/18/prepaying-2018-state-income-taxes-is-blocked-in-gop-bill.html) reports:

>(Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that property taxes could not be prepaid.)

[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2017/12/16/the-tax-bill-is-finalized-whos-happy-and-whos-not/#760ccce12288_) says:

>The final bill eliminates this opportunity, however, by explicitly denying the ability to prepay 2018 taxes in 2017. It appears, however, that the language would preclude you from prepaying only income taxes, and not property taxes.

[Businessinsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/prepay-property-taxes-before-trump-tax-plan-passes-2017-12) provided ways how to prepay _property tax_, and then it continues:

>We originally suggested that it might be worth it for some taxpayers to prepay their 2018 state and local income tax liability this year to maximize that deduction as well.

>But that's no longer possible: the new bill says that state and local income taxes paid for any tax year beginning in 2018 will not be deductible on your 2017 taxes.

[A CPA](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/news/2017/dec/tax-deduction-for-prepaying-anticipated-state-income-tax-201718054.html) argued that:

>The payment sent to a state or local government before 2018 to apply against 2018 tax liability is a mere deposit. Tax deductions are not available for deposits (Rev. Rul. 79-229).

I find the argument interesting. A deposit is usually made to hold something for you, for example, to buy a house. If you cancel your order, you may loose your deposit. I do not think I cannot cancel by property taxes.
